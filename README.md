# Scoped

This project is the frontend portion of my Capstone for Nashville Software School Full-Stack web development bootcamp. The application is inspired by past experiences at companies where the crew performing the work was left in the dark about key aspects of the work to be performed.  Scoped is a Scope of Work application that aims to provide transperancy and clear communication from client to skilled laborer.
